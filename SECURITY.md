## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Cpkg, we encourage responsible disclosure. To report a vulnerability:

1. **Contact us** via email at [zouariomar20@gmail.com](mailto:zouariomar20@gmail.com) with the details.
2. Please provide a detailed description of the issue, including steps to reproduce it and, if available, a proof of concept.
3. We aim to respond within **48 hours** and will work closely with you to resolve the issue.

We appreciate the security community's efforts in helping us maintain Cpkgâ€™s safety and integrity.

## Security Practices

Cpkg follows industry best practices for security to ensure safe transactions and protect user data:

### 1. **Authentication and Authorization**

- Cpkg uses secure methods for user authentication, including strong password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
- Access control is implemented to restrict unauthorized actions.

### 2. **Data Encryption**

- All sensitive data is encrypted in transit (via HTTPS/TLS) and at rest, including user credentials and personal information.

### 3. **SQL Injection Protection**

- Parameterized queries and prepared statements are used throughout to prevent SQL injection.
- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is leveraged where possible.

### 4. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention**

- User inputs are sanitized and validated to prevent XSS attacks, and user-generated content is escaped to avoid code injection.

### 5. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**

- CSRF tokens are included in forms and API requests to secure user actions.

### 6. **Third-Party Dependency Management**

- Dependencies are regularly scanned for vulnerabilities with tools such as [OWASP Dependency-Check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/).
- Critical security patches for dependencies are applied promptly.

### 7. **Secure Configuration**

- Default settings follow secure configurations, and sensitive data is stored securely (e.g., `.env` files for environment-specific settings).

### 8. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**

- A strict CSP is enforced to limit content sources, reducing the risk of XSS and unauthorized resource loading.

### 9. **Monitoring and Logging**

- Logs are maintained for key operations and monitored for abnormal patterns. Logs avoid storing sensitive information.
